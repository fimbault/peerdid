# peerdid
Test peerDID (fork) - small experiment

## setup

pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
cd syncexp
python syncexp.py

## notes

- fixed a few errors compared to original [pypeerdid](https://github.com/evernym/pypeerdid)
- A.2: simple still has some issues (line 151 commented out to make it work). I don't plan to work further on that right now.
