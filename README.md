# peerdid
Test peerDID (fork) - small experiment

## setup

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python setup.py install
- cd syncexp
- python syncexp.py

## notes

- fixed a few errors compared to original [pypeerdid](https://github.com/evernym/pypeerdid)
- A.2: simple still has some issues (line 151 commented out to make it work). I don't plan to work further on that right now.
